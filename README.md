# Machine Learning Fun Project 01


## Fifa Mobile Players Evaluation

Concept is pretty simple. I wanted to buy players in my fifa mobile app but I got less money. I was comparing pretty well. But got confused several times. So, I thought why not just scale them in MinMaxScaler with their attribute. That's what is done here. Oh, yeah. I bought some players with that money.





## Feel free to fork the project. Fill up with your selective players in the data section and run in notebook.
